2023-11-30 21:56:03,903 - User input: Use file id: file-hY7pAxWnjRAUWEkf7hysj74F to create schedule for this semester for a Computer Science major, including a mix of computer science classes.
Response: To create a schedule for a Computer Science major this semester, including a mix of computer science classes that are both in-person and online, I have selected a variety of courses based on the information available in the document. Below is a proposed schedule:

**Monday:**
- COMP 429, Computer Networks, 4:00 PM - 5:50 PM (Sierra Hall 1131)

**Tuesday:**
- IT 424, Computer System Security, 12:00 PM - 1:15 PM (Sierra Hall 1131)
- COMP 162, Computer Arch & Assembly Lang LEC, 8:00 AM - 9:50 AM (Sierra Hall 1232)

**Wednesday:**
Online Elective(s)
(Asynchronous, complete assignments during the week at your own pace)

**Thursday:**
- IT 424, Computer System Security (follow-up to Tuesday's class), 12:00 PM - 1:15 PM (Sierra Hall 1131)
- IT 429, Computer Networks (Lab), 3:00 PM - 5:50 PM (Sierra Hall 1232)

**Friday:**
- COMP 162, Computer Arch & Assembly Lang LAB, 8:00 AM - 10:50 AM (Sierra Hall 1232)

**Online Electives (Asynchronous):**
- COMP 447, Societal Issues in Computing
- COMP 449, Human-Computer Interaction (multiple sections available)
- COMP 424, Computer System Security Lab

Since COMP 162, IT 424, and COMP 429 have labs or multiple weekly meetings, they help to provide a full curriculum focused on core computer science and information technology concepts, as well as a practical application in lab sessions. The online electives offer flexibility and allow a student to engage with various important topics in computing such as human-computer interaction, security, and societal issues.

Please note that this is a sample schedule and actual enrollment should be based on individual graduation requirements, prerequisites, and availability at registration. Always consult with an academic advisor to ensure that the selected courses fulfill your specific program requirements.
